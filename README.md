GalaxyQuest
===========

A Spaceteam clone done during HackNJIT

Will be using the iOS MultipeerConnectivity framework to implement a peer-to-peer networked game

TODO:
----
[ ] Multipeer connection
[ ] Data models for the different types of controls
[ ] Methods for passing commands between devices
[ ] Methods for handling UI set up
[ ] Methods for handling UI updates
[ ] Fancy-shmancey UI
and a ton of other things I haven't added yet

If you are on NJIT campus, own an iphone, and want to play the game at the end, please let me know.
